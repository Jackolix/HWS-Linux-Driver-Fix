# HWS Linux Driver Fix

This repository contains fixes for the HWS Linux Driver to make it compatible with newer Linux kernel versions, specifically tested on Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS with kernel 6.8.0-49-generic.

## Background

The original HWS Linux Driver (version 1.0.0.230324) has compatibility issues with newer Linux kernels due to:
1. Use of deprecated kernel functions
2. Reference to removed struct members

These fixes allow the driver to compile and work on modern Linux distributions.

## Issues Fixed

1. Replaced deprecated `strlcpy` function with `strscpy`
   - This function was removed in newer kernel versions
   - Affects string copying operations in the driver

2. Removed reference to `min_buffers_needed`
   - This field was removed from `struct vb2_queue`
   - Affects video buffer queue initialization

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jackolix/HWS-Linux-Driver-Fix.git
```

2. Navigate to the scripts directory:
```bash
cd HWS-Linux-Driver-Fix/scripts

3. Run the installation script:
